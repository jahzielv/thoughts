Onivim 2 is looking really good! I'm excited for it to become more mature. I installed the latest updates and it starts up wayyy faster than VSCode. I probably won't be switching away from VSCode and normal vim until some of the crashes are under control, but as soon as they are I'll definitely try onivim as my daily driver.

I found another <em>thoughts</em> page today! <a href="https://evy.garden/thoughts/#1590678997">https://evy.garden/thoughts/#1590678997</a> This thought gave me an idea for an RSS reader/aggregator, but for <em>thoughts</em> pages. Technically it wouldn't be too hard, and it would be cool to add onto Hemingway. Evy's last bullet in that thought though makes me think that maybe having a "feed" would kind of defeat the purpose of the whole <em>thoughts</em> experiment. I may just implement it and then see how it feels using it.

I left my keyboard at church (it was needed to help set up a new computer we got to run our A/V equipment), so I get to try out having my MacBook out this week. It usually sits closed underneath my monitor stand. Pros: I get to use the trackpad, which is one of the greatest things about this machine. Cons: I have to use the keyboard, which is one of the worst things about this machine. I don't hate it, but it really can't hold a candle to my mechanical keyboard and its 67g <br>

Hey hey it works!! Full disclosure tho: I published to crates.io and then discovered I had a really silly bug (I was writing to the config file before I actually changed the data that was going in, so I couldn't add any feeds). This attempt at installing the app was my second, after fixing that bug and re-publishing. Anyway, check the code out at <a href="https://github.com/jahzielv/hemingway">https://github.com/jahzielv/hemingway</a> and install it with <code>cargo install hemingway</code>.

I saw a diagram in my class today describing a hypothetical web app. The client apparently would be constantly polling the backend to find and display changes in the data, which didn't sit right with me.

Oh btw, today's project is an RSS reader in Rust. I was looking around at some blogs and realized that I don't have an RSS, so I set out to build my own and try to keep on the Rust learning path. There has been some definite struggling with the borrow checker, but more because I didn't know an idiomatic way to resolve the problem and less because I didn't know what was going on. Tip: it helps if you think of lifetimes as scopes!

I've been looking at Mastodon a good bit recently. I really think that it can provide a good middle ground between the convenience of social media and the old-fashioned way of socializing (having several different communities that you interacted with in different ways). I love the idea of Mastodon instances acting as villages of sorts on the Web. I'm going to try and set up an instance myself! It's a pretty involved process, but it'll give me a chance to do some cool stuff like set up <br>
my own SMTP server.

I wonder: how has (in some cases extreme) support of the military and police become such a central part of conservative/Republican ideology? The military and law enforcement represent the long arm of the government that folks on the right are supposed to fear and dislike. It seems to me to be very inconsistent and I think that those who see this support and draw the conclusion that conservatives only support small government if it agrees with them are justified in their conclusions.

Holy cannoli if there's something I hate, it's one word tweets. Which is why I've said from the get-go that Twitter is an absolutely horrible way to transact ideas.

I guess I hadn't mentioned that. I went down to downtown Atlanta on Friday to cover the protest for The Technique, where I'm an editor. There has been so much happen these past few days... It's been hard to process. There is so much pain, so much suffering. I'm glad that I'm in a position to write about what happened, to be able to do something rather than nothing. Writing an accurate and faithful report of the events of the peaceful protest against police brutality is a <br>
privilige and an honor. I'm going to try to do my best to present the facts and hopefully shed some light on what the situation was like up until about 6pm that day.

I started working on Scratch projects with my girlfriend this past week and she's having so much fun and it's making me so happy

We added custom firmware to her 3DS so that she could trick out her Animal Crossing New Leaf setup, and she got super interested in doing more computer stuff! She's made some cute stories and games on Scratch and it just warms my heart 💗

<p>Really fascinating article and thread about software and capitalism: https://lobste.rs/s/8mroaa/where_did_software_go_wrong</p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of thinking about these topics recently. Perhaps the biggest realization that I've had is that capital is an <em>abstraction</em>. It is an abstraction for work and for value. I think that I'd understood this logically before, but desribing it in terms of an abstraction helped me internalize it as a computer person. And as a computer person, abstractions are my bread and butter. We know that abstractions help us reach heights that we can't achieve without them. We also
know that abstractions have <em>costs</em>. One of these costs is the loss of awareness of the abstractions beneath you, of the layers that are supporting you in reaching for new heights. And in any system related to humans, whether a computer system or an economic/political one, HUMANS are the bottom layer. Humans are the turtle at the bottom of the stack, and we lose awareness of them the more we abstract away our inconvenieces. America has perfected the art and science of creating
and harnessing abstractions. We have made incredible advances in many areas of society. These advances would not have been possible without our dedication to abstraction, to removing inefficiencies and pursuing perfection. Yet these abstractions, these improvements, have cost us. They have left us disengaged from that fundamental, bottom turtle: the human being.</p>


I hope to fight to engage with the human behind everything I do. It is the call that I have as a fellow human, and it is the call that my God has given me. I think that this is where Jesus really provides the only framework for a restored humanity: He is the God of plenty, and He also knows each individual more deeply than anyone else. He calls us to be "be concerned about the whole man", as Reverend Martin Luther King put it. I want to be a person concerned with the whole man.


We now return to your regularly scheduled programming.

Ahhh nothing like the satisfaction of squashing a tricky bug. Found out that you can't see pre-flight OPTIONS requests in Chrome, so I installed HTTP Toolkit and my life changed. This will be one of my main tools for building and debugging web apps! First day as a software contractor has come to a very nice conclusion! Time for dinner now 😋

Case in point for clunky interactions: break-out rooms that turn into a group text chat. Folks in my classes almost always stay muted and carry out the conversation (if they participate at all!) via the built-in chat. Leads to just a couple of people talking, and basically no conversation happening. No one wants to unmute and talk if others don't.

Is it just me, or are classes that rely heavily on interactive learning suffering big time by being online? My ethics class feels super clunky when having student interactions with each other or with instructors.

If there's anything I'm proud of accomplishing during lockdown, it's finally being able to touch type (pretty much). Practice makes perfect, and I've been practicing <em>a lot</em>. I typed this whole thought without looking at my keyboard!

Also, I'm starting a new job today! I picked up a contractor job this past week with a start-up out of Nashville. Will be working on a React project, building out their website and adding new features. Should be fun! Glad I learned Hook earlier for the Technique's mobile app that I've been working on.

Hey hey it works! I tried adding MD support but was hitting a lot of walls so I switched over to adding link support.<br>
sed is a really cool program! It's one of those things that I've been scared to try to use for some reason (I think because the syntax is super different), but I found a great guide here: <a href=https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html>https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html</a> that really demystified it!

I found a markdown parser written in shell that only uses Unix tools: https://github.com/chadbraunduin/markdown.bash<br>
Might be something to look into adding to thoughts! I'll play around with it this afternoon and if it works I'll send in a PR.

Hello thoughts! I like that this is in between Twitter (which can be intimidating) and a blog post (which requires much more effort). Might try posting here as I'm working on code!
