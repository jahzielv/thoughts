Sound really does have the ability to take you back in a very clear way. I wish I could incorporate the audio of protesters chanting "No justice, no peace". Also big shoutout to my phone's microphone for being good enough to pick up so much audio with such high quality. I can make out conversations and snippets of what people were saying around me, and it's taking me back to being there.

I guess I hadn't mentioned that. I went down to downtown Atlanta on Friday to cover the protest for The Technique, where I'm an editor. There has been so much happen these past few days... It's been hard to process. There is so much pain, so much suffering. I'm glad that I'm in a position to write about what happened, to be able to do something rather than nothing. Writing an accurate and faithful report of the events of the peaceful protest against police brutality is a <br>
privilige and an honor. I'm going to try to do my best to present the facts and hopefully shed some light on what the situation was like up until about 6pm that day.

I started working on Scratch projects with my girlfriend this past week and she's having so much fun and it's making me so happy

We added custom firmware to her 3DS so that she could trick out her Animal Crossing New Leaf setup, and she got super interested in doing more computer stuff! She's made some cute stories and games on Scratch and it just warms my heart ðŸ’—

<p>Really fascinating article and thread about software and capitalism: https://lobste.rs/s/8mroaa/where_did_software_go_wrong</p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of thinking about these topics recently. Perhaps the biggest realization that I've had is that capital is an <em>abstraction</em>. It is an abstraction for work and for value. I think that I'd understood this logically before, but desribing it in terms of an abstraction helped me internalize it as a computer person. And as a computer person, abstractions are my bread and butter. We know that abstractions help us reach heights that we can't achieve without them. We also
know that abstractions have <em>costs</em>. One of these costs is the loss of awareness of the abstractions beneath you, of the layers that are supporting you in reaching for new heights. And in any system related to humans, whether a computer system or an economic/political one, HUMANS are the bottom layer. Humans are the turtle at the bottom of the stack, and we lose awareness of them the more we abstract away our inconvenieces. America has perfected the art and science of creating
and harnessing abstractions. We have made incredible advances in many areas of society. These advances would not have been possible without our dedication to abstraction, to removing inefficiencies and pursuing perfection. Yet these abstractions, these improvements, have cost us. They have left us disengaged from that fundamental, bottom turtle: the human being.</p>


I hope to fight to engage with the human behind everything I do. It is the call that I have as a fellow human, and it is the call that my God has given me. I think that this is where Jesus really provides the only framework for a restored humanity: He is the God of plenty, and He also knows each individual more deeply than anyone else. He calls us to be "be concerned about the whole man", as Reverend Martin Luther King put it. I want to be a person concerned with the whole man.


We now return to your regularly scheduled programming.

Ahhh nothing like the satisfaction of squashing a tricky bug. Found out that you can't see pre-flight OPTIONS requests in Chrome, so I installed HTTP Toolkit and my life changed. This will be one of my main tools for building and debugging web apps! First day as a software contractor has come to a very nice conclusion! Time for dinner now ðŸ˜‹

Case in point for clunky interactions: break-out rooms that turn into a group text chat. Folks in my classes almost always stay muted and carry out the conversation (if they participate at all!) via the built-in chat. Leads to just a couple of people talking, and basically no conversation happening. No one wants to unmute and talk if others don't.

Is it just me, or are classes that rely heavily on interactive learning suffering big time by being online? My ethics class feels super clunky when having student interactions with each other or with instructors.

If there's anything I'm proud of accomplishing during lockdown, it's finally being able to touch type (pretty much). Practice makes perfect, and I've been practicing <em>a lot</em>. I typed this whole thought without looking at my keyboard!

Also, I'm starting a new job today! I picked up a contractor job this past week with a start-up out of Nashville. Will be working on a React project, building out their website and adding new features. Should be fun! Glad I learned Hook earlier for the Technique's mobile app that I've been working on.

Hey hey it works! I tried adding MD support but was hitting a lot of walls so I switched over to adding link support.<br>
sed is a really cool program! It's one of those things that I've been scared to try to use for some reason (I think because the syntax is super different), but I found a great guide here: <a href=https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html>https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html</a> that really demystified it!

Hello thoughts! I like that this is in between Twitter (which can be intimidating) and a blog post (which requires much more effort). Might try posting here as I'm working on code!
