Case in point for clunky interactions: break-out rooms that turn into a group text chat. Folks in my classes almost always stay muted and carry out the conversation (if they participate at all!) via the built-in chat. Leads to just a couple of people talking, and basically no conversation happening. No one wants to unmute and talk if others don't.

Is it just me, or are classes that rely heavily on interactive learning suffering big time by being online? My ethics class feels super clunky when having student interactions with each other or with instructors.

If there's anything I'm proud of accomplishing during lockdown, it's finally being able to touch type (pretty much). Practice makes perfect, and I've been practicing <em>a lot</em>. I typed this whole thought without looking at my keyboard!

Also, I'm starting a new job today! I picked up a contractor job this past week with a start-up out of Nashville. Will be working on a React project, building out their website and adding new features. Should be fun! Glad I learned Hook earlier for the Technique's mobile app that I've been working on.

Hey hey it works! I tried adding MD support but was hitting a lot of walls so I switched over to adding link support.<br>
sed is a really cool program! It's one of those things that I've been scared to try to use for some reason (I think because the syntax is super different), but I found a great guide here: <a href=https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html>https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html</a> that really demystified it!

this is a cool website I found! <a href=https://www.example.com/hello/goodbye?a=one&b=two>https://www.example.com/hello/goodbye?a=one&b=two</a><br>
There's some really neat stuff posted there.<br>
I don't know if it's as cool as this other one though...<a href=https://www.exmple.com/hello/goodbye?a=three&b=four>https://www.exmple.com/hello/goodbye?a=three&b=four</a>

I found a markdown parser written in shell that only uses Unix tools: https://github.com/chadbraunduin/markdown.bash<br>
Might be something to look into adding to thoughts! I'll play around with it this afternoon and if it works I'll send in a PR.

Hello thoughts! I like that this is in between Twitter (which can be intimidating) and a blog post (which requires much more effort). Might try posting here as I'm working on code!
