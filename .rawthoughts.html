this is a cool website I found! <a href=https://www.example.com/hello/goodbye?a=one&b=two>https://www.example.com/hello/goodbye?a=one&b=two</a><br>
There's some really neat stuff posted there.<br>
I don't know if it's as cool as this other one though...<a href=https://www.example.com/hello/goodbye?a=three&b=four>https://www.example.com/hello/goodbye?a=three&b=four</a>

Hey hey it works! I tried adding MD support but was hitting a lot of walls so I switched over to adding link support.<br>
sed is a really cool program! It's one of those things that I've been scared to try to use for some reason (I think because the syntax is super different), but I found a great guide here: <a href=https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html>https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html</a> that really demystified it!

I found a markdown parser written in shell that only uses Unix tools: https://github.com/chadbraunduin/markdown.bash<br>
Might be something to look into adding to thoughts! I'll play around with it this afternoon and if it works I'll send in a PR.

Hello thoughts! I like that this is in between Twitter (which can be intimidating) and a blog post (which requires much more effort). Might try posting here as I'm working on code!
