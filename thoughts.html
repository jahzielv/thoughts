Mastodon install update: It's done!! https://thecabal.xyz is live! The 301 redirect loop was caused by some duplicate nginx config blocks. http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html#:~:text=In%20the%20configuration%20above%2C%20the,.net%3B%20...%20%7D and https://serversforhackers.com/c/redirect-http-to-https-nginx helped me out a lot in terms of actually understanding the nginx config file. Otherwise, I stuck pretty closely to the Mastodon setup guide here: https://computingforgeeks.com/install-mastodon-on-ubuntu-with-letsencrypt-ssl-certificate/

I've been looking at Mastodon a good bit recently. I really think that it can provide a good middle ground between the convenience of social media and the old-fashioned way of socializing (having several different communities that you interacted with in different ways). I love the idea of Mastodon instances acting as villages of sorts on the Web. I'm going to try and set up an instance myself! It's a pretty involved process, but it'll give me a chance to do some cool stuff like set up <br>
my own SMTP server.

I cannot believe that there are so few audio UIs for React. Most of the projects I've found are either 5 years old or wrappers around audio libraries that don't provide a UI. There's modern UIs available for most things, why not audio players??

Just ordered Capital, The Wealth of Nations, The Federalist Papers, and So You Want to Talk About Race. Gonna start my increased involvement with some reading! The first 3 I've wanted to read for a while; I think they'll give some good context for the underlying ideas of the current culture. The last one I got from a great Notion BLM database full of resources to get educated on the issue of racism in America. Looking forward to digging in!

I wonder: how has (in some cases extreme) support of the military and police become such a central part of conservative/Republican ideology? The military and law enforcement represent the long arm of the government that folks on the right are supposed to fear and dislike. It seems to me to be very inconsistent and I think that those who see this support and draw the conclusion that conservatives only support small government if it agrees with them are justified in their conclusions.

Holy cannoli if there's something I hate, it's one word tweets. Which is why I've said from the get-go that Twitter is an absolutely horrible way to transact ideas. I've had a policy for quite a while now that I will not tweet unless the entirety of the idea that I'm trying to convey can be contained in the tweet. Now more than ever we are killing ourselves with the huge footgun that is social media. We have the ability to communicate with great speed and scale, but we lack the <br>
ability to be judicious about what we say and how we say it.

Sound really does have the ability to take you back in a very clear way. I wish I could incorporate the audio of protesters chanting "No justice, no peace". Also big shoutout to my phone's microphone for being good enough to pick up so much audio with such high quality. I can make out conversations and snippets of what people were saying around me, and it's taking me back to being there.

I guess I hadn't mentioned that. I went down to downtown Atlanta on Friday to cover the protest for The Technique, where I'm an editor. There has been so much happen these past few days... It's been hard to process. There is so much pain, so much suffering. I'm glad that I'm in a position to write about what happened, to be able to do something rather than nothing. Writing an accurate and faithful report of the events of the peaceful protest against police brutality is a <br>
privilige and an honor. I'm going to try to do my best to present the facts and hopefully shed some light on what the situation was like up until about 6pm that day.

<p>Really fascinating article and thread about software and capitalism: https://lobste.rs/s/8mroaa/where_did_software_go_wrong</p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of thinking about these topics recently. Perhaps the biggest realization that I've had is that capital is an <em>abstraction</em>. It is an abstraction for work and for value. I think that I'd understood this logically before, but desribing it in terms of an abstraction helped me internalize it as a computer person. And as a computer person, abstractions are my bread and butter. We know that abstractions help us reach heights that we can't achieve without them. We also
know that abstractions have <em>costs</em>. One of these costs is the loss of awareness of the abstractions beneath you, of the layers that are supporting you in reaching for new heights. And in any system related to humans, whether a computer system or an economic/political one, HUMANS are the bottom layer. Humans are the turtle at the bottom of the stack, and we lose awareness of them the more we abstract away our inconvenieces. America has perfected the art and science of creating
and harnessing abstractions. We have made incredible advances in many areas of society. These advances would not have been possible without our dedication to abstraction, to removing inefficiencies and pursuing perfection. Yet these abstractions, these improvements, have cost us. They have left us disengaged from that fundamental, bottom turtle: the human being.</p>


I hope to fight to engage with the human behind everything I do. It is the call that I have as a fellow human, and it is the call that my God has given me. I think that this is where Jesus really provides the only framework for a restored humanity: He is the God of plenty, and He also knows each individual more deeply than anyone else. He calls us to be "be concerned about the whole man", as Reverend Martin Luther King put it. I want to be a person concerned with the whole man.


We now return to your regularly scheduled programming.

Case in point for clunky interactions: break-out rooms that turn into a group text chat. Folks in my classes almost always stay muted and carry out the conversation (if they participate at all!) via the built-in chat. Leads to just a couple of people talking, and basically no conversation happening. No one wants to unmute and talk if others don't.
